# iFound.one

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Web App is almost progressive, solely the no-js prerender still needs to be added. [Check it out!](https://www.iFound.one)


### Back-End

This is the NodeJS [REST API](https://api.ifound.one) Back-End, using Express with Multer, Mongoose, JWT Authorisation and polyfilled Fetch support.

**Note: The external PHP file server is excluded from this repo for security reasons.**
